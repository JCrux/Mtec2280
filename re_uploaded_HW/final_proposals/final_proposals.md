Proposal 1)I would like to create a robot arm that would play "rock paper scissors". The robot would be dubbed Jan-ken. 
I would need to figure out how to time the arms reaction to match the users, and instead of a hand that moves it would have 
3 hands/arms one for rock, paper, and scissors.

Proposal 2) I would like to create a robot arm where it takes in audio stimulus, depending on the frequency and pitch 
the robot arm would dance. I would need to learn how to take in audio inputs, and randomize the robots arm movements and 
make it truly random.

Proposal 3) I would like to create a robot arm in which it draws your name in various grafitti styles 
based on some library of fonts/styles. The arm would take in inputs from a keyboard where in would recieve infromation.
I would neeed to figure out how to get the arm to recreate these styles as well limit the space of which it draws on.
