1)The first project was Richard The's parasite projector. It weas interesting that moving illusions were being brought to life on highspeed 
trains to accomplish this you would need balls of steel, the local transit authority and minor skills in projection mapping.
 
2)The second project that grabbed my attention was Thijs Rijkers suicide machine, it came off as a way to troll. What other than to build
something that has no other purpoise than to destroy its self. It poors sand into its own gears, which then grinds the gears until they are
completelyninoperable. To create a project like this you would need some  basic knowledege of electricity, some coding background and 
an arduino.
 
3) The third project that really connected with me was the "Eye Writer" by Graffiti Research Lab. The "Eye Writer" is a sensor which tracks 
the movement of ones eye to write/draw freely using very minor hardware and free source software. As an aspiring artist, the fact that there 
is another way to express ones self is cool  in itself through new channels; additionally this benefits those who are limited 
due to physical disabilites. To replicate a project similar to this one would need skills in woth coding, knowledge of components that work
with taking in and tracking input similar to photo cells(motion sensor). The eyewrite is demonstrated by a man who has advanced ALS, and is 
able to get another chacne to use his once stolen talents.
