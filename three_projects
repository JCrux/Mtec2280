1)The first project was Richard The's parasite projector. It weas interesting that moving illusions were being brought to life on highspeed 
trains to accomplish this you would need balls of steel, the local transit authority and minor skills in projection mapping.
 
 2)The second project that grabbed my attention was Thijs Rijkers suicide machine, it came off as a way to troll. What other than to build
 something that has no other purpoise than to destroy its self. It poors sand into its own gears, which then grinds the gears until they are
 completelyninoperable. To create a project like this you would need some  basic knowledege of electricity, some coding background and 
 an atduono
